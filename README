dccpping is a ping-like utility using DCCP Request packets to elict a response
from another host. It is designed to determine whether a remote host is DCCP
aware and whether or not a middle box is blocking DCCP packets.

In order to build this program, please simply type "make" at the commandline.
I have not included a ./configure script with this program because this
program will only compile on linux anyway (we need the dccp header include file)
and it comprises only a few files. If you have problems, simply modify the
makefile as needed. Contact me, if major problems arise.


Usage is pretty simple:
dccpping: [-d] [-v] [-h] [-n] [-6|-4] [-c count] [-p port] [-i interval]
          [-t ttl] [-S srcaddress] remote_host

          -d   Debug. May be repeated for aditional verbosity
          -v   Version information
          -h   Help
          -6   Force IPv6 mode
          -4   Force IPv4 mode
          -n   Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
               names for host addresses.
		  -c   Number of requests to make. The default is unlimited.
		  -p   The DCCP port to send requests to. The default is 33434.
		  -i   Interval between requests in seconds. The default is 1 second.
		  -t   The TTL to set in the sent requests. The default is 64.
		  -S   Source Address. The address to send packets from. Should
		  	   only be needed if the autodetection fails.
		  	   
		  remote_host can be either an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) or a hostname.
